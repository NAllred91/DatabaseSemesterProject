DatabaseSemesterProject
=======================

This is the project for Fall Semester COSC 457.  


The website is hosted at :

            nick.dlogicd.com
                  -OR-
            www.dlogicd.com:6591
            
            

This site is served by a Node.js server and has a MySQL database.

The source code is organized into a "Client" and "NodeServer" directory.  The "Client" directory contains the code that is served up to the web browser, including html, css, and javascript.  The "NodeServer" directory contains the javascript that runs server side.

** The most important file to look at for this project is DatabaseSemesterProject/NodeServer/DatabaseInterface.js **

The data dictionary, user guide, EER diagram, schema diagram, postmortem writeup, an empty database dump (just schema), and a full database dump are located in the DatabaseSemesterProject directory.
