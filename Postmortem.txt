Upon completion of this project we had a functioning web server with a MySQL database.  All functionality appears to work as expected and nothing crashes under normal use.  If we were to do this project again we may use a prewritten user authentication system (although I enjoyed writing it myself).  Additionally, we would have designed the database making it easier to remove a user from the system.  This could be done by providing the user with a username and a display name that is changed to “Inactive User” when the user deactivates their account.

Additional content that we would like to add would be including support for adding a user avatar.  We would also like to improve the search functionality to extend to searching the forum.  Some minor bugs exist when viewing the web page on an iOS device, although these bugs wouldn’t be readily noticeable to most users.
